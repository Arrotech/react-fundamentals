**What is react?**

- React is an open source javascript library for building user interfaces.
- React has a rich ecosystem that handles routing, http requests and other functionalities.

**Architecture**

- React is made of components which can be combined to make a rich and huge UI.
- Components make it possible to have reusable code in angular and vue.
- React is declarative.

**Prerequisites**

As a beginner one should acquire the below basics.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript(ES6).
- Javascript - "this" keyword, map, filter and reduce
- ES6 - let & const, arrow functions, template literals, default parameters, object literals, rest and spread      operators, and destructuring assignment.
 
**COMPONENTS**

- Root/app component. This is the entry part of the application.

**Component types**

1. **Stateless functional components**

- These are simply javascript functions which return html which describe the UI.

2. **Stateful class components** 

- These are regular ES6 classes that extend the component class from react library.
- They contain a render method which return HTML.

**Functional vs Class components**

1. **Functional/dumb/stateless/presentational components**

- Absence of "this" keyword
- Focuses on the UI rather than complicated states

2. **Class/stateful/smart/container components**

- Mantain private data aslo known as state
- Complex UI logic
- Provide lifecycle hooks
